# Remember Your Media

> Please do not look at the source code, if you want to know how to make web applications. This certainly is not a good way. The reason why I do something as absurd as using python here, is because it is a school project.

Remember Your Media is an application for keeping track of what films, music, books, comics or other media you have bought.

There are 6 categories: films, music, books, music, games and other. You can also add friends and mark some items if you want to borrow from each other.

# Week 2
Because of a not course related reason I was not really able to focus on the project this week.
