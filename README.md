# Remember Your Media
> Database NUKE on 27. june 2021

Remember Your Media is an application for keeping track of what films, music, books, comics or other media you have bought. You can try it out [here](https://remember-your-media.herokuapp.com/) (only for testing, data may be lost).

There are 6 categories: films, music, books, music, games and other. You will also be able to add friends and see if they could share something.

# Short Guide
To start using the webpage you can select to Log in or register from the navigation bar (top). After that you can use the navigation bar to select:
* **RYM** to see a welcome page
* **Browse** to browse saved media (select media type from second navigation bar). To edit or remove saved items you have to browse them first and then press the corresponding hyperlink on the right side of the media item.
* **Add New** to add a new media item. Only the title is mandatory (select media type from second navigation bar). If the media that you are adding has many of something (for example Directors) you can separate them with commas.
* **Friends** to see current friends, send friend requests, accept friend requests or remove friends.

# Development
I will probably not continue to work on this project, because this prerender all html thing just seems to maka a lot of unnessessary traffic for the server adn database.

# Loppupalautus (Related to a school project)
Nytten on sankarikoodattu viimeisenä iltana :)

Koodi jäi erittäin epämukavaan kuntoon mutta voi voi niin jäi käyttöliittymän ulkoasukin... https://youtube.com/watch?v=SETnK2ny1R0
