Remember Your Media is an application for keeping track of what films, music, books, comics or other media you have bought. You can try it out [here](https://remember-your-media.herokuapp.com/)(only for testing, data may be lost).

There are 6 categories: films, music, books, music, games and other. You can also add friends and mark some items if you want to borrow from each other.
